# IntuitiveRussianKeyboard
This program provides an easier typing experience for people who wish to type in Russian, but are used to the QWERTY-US layout.
This runs using AutoHotkey (learn more at www.autohotkey.com).
I personally have it set up to run at startup, and I pause and unpause it using my SCROLL LOCK key.
Traditional shortcuts (Ctrl + C, Ctrl + Z, etc) still work as normal.

For layout specifics, refer to layout.jpg included in the file.
